# Citrix-Logon-Simulator

Full blogpost is [here](https://stevenlemonier.fr/citrix-logon-simulator)
## Pre-requisites

To run the script, you must have the following pre-requisites:

- Python 3 ([Official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- Tesseract, for OCR ([Windows build](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki))
- Tesseract installation folder added to Windows PATH environment variable
- Firefox ([Official website](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)) 
- Geckodriver, aligned with Firefox version you installed ([Github repository](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases))
- you **MUST** enable HTML5 receiver as the script does not rely on Citrix Workspace App

Once all those pre-requisites are installed, you must run the following command in PowerShell to download the modules required to run Citrix Logon Simulator (the machine you running the script on must have internet access):

```Python
pip install selenium pypiwin32 requests pyautogui Pillow pytesseract
```

To write events in Windows Event Log, the Event Source must be created first (value can be modified within the Python script, just edit the variable 'EventSource'). In Powershell, execute the following commands, as an Administrator:
```PowerShell
$eventsource = "Citrix.LogonSimulator" #Align the value with the one you edited in the Python script
$EventLogSourceParams = @{
    LogName = 'Application'
    Source = $eventsource
}
New-EventLog @EventLogSourceParams
```

## Edit the variables

Before running the logon simulator, you must edit some variables to adapt it to your environment:
- EventSource (The event's source of the events that will be written in Windows Event Log)
- username (do I need to explain?)
- password (really?)
- URL (doesn't matter if it's a Citrix Gateway or a Storefront, https or not, just enter the URL you want to log to)
- ResourceToTest (the published resource to launch, it must be added to the favorites for the testing user before running the script)
- Screenshotfile (where and how to name the screenshot file to do OCR to, can stay as is)
- TextToFind (to validate the application has been properly launched, the script takes a screenshot and runs OCR on it to find this text)
- LogFile (path for the log file, so you can share it with me if something does not work as expected)

## Run the script

Running the script is pretty straightforward, just run the following command in Powershell:

```Python
python CitrixLogonSimulator.py
```

You'll get the following output (at least, if it goes to end!):


What the script does:

It tries to resolve the URL, no need to go deeper if it's not accessible right!

Then, it launches an instance of Firefox and goes to the URL. It will check if it's a Citrix Gateway or a Storefront and will adapt the logon process according to its findings.

It logs on, looks for the resource to test once application enumeration is finished, and launches it.

It waits for 60 seconds and takes a screenshot.

And finally runs OCR to check if it launched the resources properly.

At each stage, it will generate some events (and logs in the logfile, of course):
- Event ID 12001, information, in case of success, with some details
- Event ID 12002, error, in case of a failure, with some details

And if it worked properly, it will generate an Event ID 12000!

Thus, if you understood correctly, monitor the machine the script is running on for Event ID 12002 (as an alert trigger) to be proactive with your applications/desktops availability!

## Limitations  

As the logon simulator is more an MVP (standing for Minimum Viable Product), it comes with some limitations I hope I'll address in a near future.

Here they are (don't worry, they're not that much big of a deal):
- to install python modules (using 'pip install' command), the computer/virtual machine must have access to the internet; for offline modules installation, it's trickier, I'm looking for a reliable way to redistribute those
- using a proxy must be tested, it may depend on the type of proxy you are using; if you have an issue with the proxy, just let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/StevenLemonier) or [open an issue on the Github repo](https://github.com/SLemonier/Citrix-Logon-Simulator), I'll be glad to help
- supported logon process is limited to login/password
- password is not encrypted, use a test account with very limited rights!
- the resource to test (application or desktop) must be added to the favorites for the testing user before running the script as told earlier
- it's not yet able to manage the logon duration, thus, it waits for 60 seconds and takes a screenshot; if your logon duration is longer (Booooh ðŸ¤­), increase the value of 'Sleep(60)'
- the script does basic OCR (I can add more processing on the image to improve the OCR), it's better to look for some text with high contrast (like black strings on white background) and to not have too much text displayed on the page
- events generated in Windows Event Log are pretty basic, and messages can be improved (I'm open to suggestions!)

One last limitation, if you're running the script for monitoring purposes, you have to use auto logon on your machine and run the script as a logon script. It does some interactive stuff (like launching Firefox and doing a screenshot) and it cannot run as an unattended script. Sorry ðŸ˜Ÿ

## Upcoming improvements

Here are some improvements I have in mind but feel free to share your suggestions, I'll be more than happy to add them:

- Improve OCR processing
- Improve messages in Windows Event Log
- Do a screenshot at every stage and store them for history
- Loof for the ResourceToTest in other tabs than the landing one once application enumeration is finished (like looking in apps or desktops tabs if the resource is not added to the favorites)
- Support MFA, but this will require your help, so, please contact me if you need such a feature!
- Encrypt password (I have a workaround with OS variables to now have it stored in plain text in the script but this solution is not perfect)
